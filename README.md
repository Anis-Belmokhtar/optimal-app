Overview: 

This is a simple React App which shows a single, centered chart displaying fake coffee prices on a given day. The buttons on the side control which data is shown; for example, clicking on "Open" adds/removes the "Open" prices.

The build for this app is hosted on an S3 bucket which is publicly accessible for demonstration purposes: http://deploy-react-app-12345.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Used technologies: React, Redux, MaterialUI, CSS, AWS S3.

Next steps: 
    - Host the data on a database. 
    - Split the app into a frontend and backend.
    - Make api calls to request data from the backend. 
    - Make the screen prettier, add more components. 
    - Adapt code to use Typescript instead, to avoid errors generated from a lack of type-checking.
